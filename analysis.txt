I wanted to do a comparison year over year for a specific month. I decided on September as that was the last month to have the full data at the time I 
started on this project. As I was reviewing the data I noticed the differences in usage based on gender and decided to focus on that.

The first observation was on usage in September year over year (2018-2020). Males were always the highest in usage for each year, but male usaged declined 
in 2020 compared to 2019. Females seem to steadily increase year over year with no decline.

I also found it interesting that there was a decline in male usage because in 2020 there was quite a large increase in stations compared to 2019. With more
opportunities with more stations usage was down in September 2020. Not sure if this was the cause but maybe COVID-19 played a part. Although, it did not 
seem to impact female usage in the same way.

Although males use the Citi bikes more often females and "Unknown" genders have longer trip durations year over year. It seems that males use them on 
average for shorter periods of time.
